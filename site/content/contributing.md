## Setup

- Flutter and Dart through [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev): `mise install` reads
  `mise.toml`. Every Dart/Flutter command below is `mise exec -- ...`.
- Rust through rustup, plus `cargo install cbindgen` (only for C ABI changes).
- A C toolchain (Xcode command line tools / NDK) for the app link step.

```bash
mise exec -- dart pub get        # resolves the whole workspace, melos included
```

## Repo shape

```
pubspec.yaml     pub workspace + melos config (`melos:` key)
Cargo.toml       Cargo workspace: every crate under packages/*/rust (and slint_interpreter/interpreter)
packages/        the Dart packages, each with its Rust crate(s) inside
examples/        apps consuming the packages through the workspace
```

The root `README.md` describes each package; each package has a `README.md`
(documentation of record) and an `AGENTS.md` (invariants and traps, for
humans and AI agents alike).

## Everyday commands

The short form is `just` (installed by mise): `just` lists the recipes,
`just check` runs what CI runs, `just bindings slint_testing` regenerates a
package's FFI bindings. `examples/todo/justfile` has the release builds and
the tree-shaking check (`just build-macos`, then `just verify-treeshake`);
`examples/todo_skia/justfile` the two things that run locally there.

Underneath, melos is a root dev dependency; run it with `dart run`:

```bash
mise exec -- dart run melos run analyze        # dart analyze, per package
mise exec -- dart run melos run test           # Dart packages, then Flutter packages and examples/todo
mise exec -- dart run melos run codegen        # ui/*.slint → lib/*.g.dart in the examples
mise exec -- dart run melos run rust:clippy    # every crate except slint-skia-ffi
mise exec -- dart run melos run check          # everything CI runs
mise exec -- dart run melos list               # what's in the workspace
```

`melos run` with no script name lists the scripts and their descriptions.
Or go direct — `cd packages/<pkg> && mise exec -- dart test`, `cd examples/todo
&& mise exec -- flutter test`; see `AGENTS.md` for the full list.

First runs are slow: `flutter test` and `slint_testing`'s `dart test` build
their Rust crates through the native-assets hooks (release profile, minutes).
Nothing needs a manual `cargo build`.

## What never runs locally

`slint_skia`'s crate pulls in all of Skia. `cargo build/check/clippy` of
`slint-skia-ffi`, and `flutter run/build/test` of `examples/todo_skia`, are
CI-only. The melos scripts already skip them; `dart run build_runner build`
and `dart analyze .` are the local checks for `todo_skia`.

## Dead code and size

`dart analyze` already flags unused locals, fields, and imports. For
anything wider:

```bash
cargo install cargo-machete cargo-bloat
mise exec -- dart pub global activate dart_code_linter
mise exec -- dart run melos run deps:unused    # cargo machete: unused Rust dependencies
mise exec -- dart run melos run dart:unused    # dart_code_linter check-unused-code, per package
```

`dart:unused` reports the builders and hook entry points (`slintBuilder`,
`buildSlintAot`, ...) as unused — they are reached through `build.yaml` and
the apps' `hook/*.dart`, not by Dart imports. `cargo machete` lists
`slint-skia-ffi`'s Skia dependencies: the skeleton does not reference them
yet (see its `AGENTS.md`).

Release size is the AOT dylib; `packages/slint_compiler/README.md` has the
measured breakdown ("Where the bytes go") and the `cargo bloat` recipe.

## Before opening a PR

1. `mise exec -- dart run melos run check` is green.
2. A release build of the example still tree-shakes when the change touches
   codegen or hooks:
   `cd examples/todo && FLUTTER_RECORD_USE=true mise exec -- flutter build macos --release`
   (see `packages/slint_compiler/AGENTS.md` for what to verify in the bundle).
3. Generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.aot.g.dart`, `bindings.g.dart`,
   `rust/include/*.h`) are regenerated, not hand-edited, and committed.
4. The affected package `README.md` is updated in the same change; a new
   invariant lands in that package's `AGENTS.md`.

Commit messages follow conventional-commit style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`,
`docs:`, `refactor:`), imperative subject, body explaining the why.

## Adding a package

1. Create it under `packages/<name>/` with `publish_to: none` and
   `resolution: workspace`.
2. Add `packages/<name>` to the root `pubspec.yaml` `workspace:` list; a
   Rust crate goes into the root `Cargo.toml` `members` with
   `[lints] workspace = true` in its own `Cargo.toml`.
3. Write its `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`; add a row to the root README's
   layout table.
4. If it ships a native library: a `hook/build.dart` through `slint_build`,
   `ffigen.yaml` + `rust/cbindgen.toml`, and the generated bindings committed.
