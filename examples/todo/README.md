# Todo Example

A Slint UI driven through one generated typed API (`TodoApp`), running on
either backend: **interpreter** (runtime compilation via `slint_interpreter`)
or **compiled** (FFI bindings to precompiled Rust).

The Rust crates are built automatically by each package's `hook/build.dart`
(Dart native assets / code assets) — no manual `cargo build`, no dylib paths.
In release/profile builds the app's `hook/link.dart` then links the AOT dylib
from the staticlib the build hook produced, tree-shaking components no
reachable Dart code uses (`@RecordUse` recordings). Recording sits behind a
Flutter experiment flag:

```bash
FLUTTER_RECORD_USE=true flutter build macos --release
```

`todo.slint` deliberately exports an `UnusedGadget` component nothing
references: with the flag on, its `slint_aot_unused_gadget_*` symbols are
absent from the shipped `slint_dart_aot` dylib; without it (or with
`recorded_uses` unavailable) every component is kept.

## Codegen

```bash
cd examples/todo && dart run build_runner build
```

The `.slint` lives in `ui/`, outside `lib/`: it is not Dart and must never
ship, and build_runner only looks there because `build.yaml` lists `ui/**`
as a source. Two files land in `lib/`, both regenerated after editing
`ui/todo.slint`:

- `lib/todo.g.dart` — `slint_generator`: the typed `TodoApp` (properties,
  callbacks, render target), the `TodoItem` value class generated from the
  `.slint` struct, plus the embedded source. Backend-agnostic — `main.dart`
  keeps the list in the shared `TodoStore` (`examples/todo_shared`) and maps
  it to `TodoItem` only at the Slint boundary, never touching a raw map.
- `lib/todo.aot.g.dart` — `slint_compiler`: the `@Native` externs and
  `todoAppFactory` for the AOT backend.

## Backends

`main.dart` names the UI by its `.slint` path and no backend at all:

```dart
TodoApp.register();                                  // once, in main()
final TodoApp app = SlintComponent.load('ui/todo.slint');   // synchronous
```

Registration is per component on purpose: `UnusedGadget` is never
registered, so nothing references its AOT factory and it is tree-shaken out
of the release dylib. `TodoApp.load('ui/todo.slint')` is the same thing
without the registry.

The generated `TodoApp.defaultFactory` picks one by build mode, matching the
dylib that actually ships (the hooks read `linkingEnabled`, true exactly for
the non-debug modes). Pass a factory to `create()` to override it — that is
what the tests do. There is nothing to await: compiling with the interpreter
and creating an AOT instance are each one FFI call, so the component is
renderable on return and `initState` needs no loading state.

Neither mode bundles or reads `ui/todo.slint`. Debug compiles the copy
`todo.g.dart` embeds; release compiles it into the AOT dylib, and the Dart
snapshot carries no copy of the text — the embedded string is referenced
only inside the interpreter branch that the const build-mode split makes
dead code. That is also why `pubspec.yaml` declares no `flutter: assets:`
entry: Flutter declares assets per package, not per build mode, so anything
listed there for debug convenience would ride along into release.

`SlintComponent.loadAsset('assets/ui/todo.slint')` is the other direction: read a
`.slint` the app ships on purpose and compile it at runtime. Interpreter
only — an AOT binary has no compiler to hand the source to — and async,
because reading the bundle is.

### Interpreter — debug builds

Compiles the source embedded in `todo.g.dart` at runtime and renders via
`slint_interpreter`. No runtime asset. The bundle ships only
`slint_interpreter_ffi`.

```bash
cd examples/todo && mise exec -- flutter run
```

### Shared state

The list itself lives in `examples/todo_shared`: `TodoStore` owns the
add/toggle/remove-done rules (trim-on-add, ignore-empty, bounds-checked
toggle), the seed list, and the AppBar title helper, unit-tested under
`dart test`. `main.dart` only maps `TodoStore.items` to the generated
`TodoItem` in `_sync()` — the same store `examples/todo_skia` drives, so a
rule change lands in both apps at once.

### Compiled — release/profile builds

Binds straight to the AOT-compiled component, no interpreter. The bundle
ships only `slint_dart_aot`.

```bash
cd examples/todo && mise exec -- flutter run --release
```

## Platforms

macOS, iOS, and Android all build and run. Each platform's Rust cross-compile
is driven by the same hooks — the target triple, the NDK clang wrapper on
Android, and the deployment target on Apple platforms come from the build
input, so there is nothing per-platform to configure:

```bash
mise exec -- flutter build macos --release
mise exec -- flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
mise exec -- flutter build apk --release --target-platform android-arm64
```

Component tree-shaking works on every one: the link hook uses `-dead_strip`
with an exported-symbols list on Apple platforms and `--gc-sections` with a
version script on Android, and `slint_aot_unused_gadget_*` is absent from the
shipped library in all three.

### Measured sizes

One `.slint` file, one screen, arm64 unless noted. Native library is the
Slint code asset the bundle ships — the whole difference between the two
backends:

| Build | macOS | iOS | Android |
| ----- | ----- | --- | ------- |
| Release app (AOT) | 58.5 MB | 23.9 MB | 25.3 MB (APK) |
| ↳ `slint_dart_aot` | 20.1 MB (universal, 2 slices) | 9.7 MB | 9.9 MB |
| Debug app (interpreter) | 134.7 MB | 127.1 MB | 96.8 MB (APK) |
| ↳ `slint_interpreter_ffi` | 26.9 MB | 27.1 MB | 19.6 MB |

The AOT library is roughly 2.8× smaller than the interpreter one, because it
carries compiled components instead of the `.slint` compiler. The rest of
each app is Flutter itself: `Flutter.framework`/`libflutter.so` is 10–39 MB
depending on platform and mode, and debug builds add an unstripped Dart
kernel plus — on Android — a 15 MB Vulkan validation layer.

macOS is the outlier because `flutter build macos` produces a universal
binary; the per-architecture figure is about half.

## Test

Both backends are tested:

```bash
cd examples/todo && mise exec -- flutter test
```

- `test/todo_typed_test.dart` — the generated `TodoApp` over the interpreter
  factory
- `test/todo_smoke_test.dart` — the untyped `slint_interpreter` API directly
- `test/todo_compiled_smoke_test.dart` — the same `TodoApp` over the AOT
  factory; self-skips under `flutter test` (always debug, so the AOT dylib
  isn't built) and runs when the AOT asset is present. `flutter build macos
  --release` still verifies the AOT codegen/compile/link end to end.

## Rust debug/release

The Rust crates build with cargo's `release` profile by default (debug Slint
rendering is unusably slow). To build them in debug, set the `profile`
user-define in the pubspec that the hook runner reads — the workspace root
`pubspec.yaml` in this repo (for a standalone app it would be the app's own):

```yaml
hooks:
  user_defines:
    slint_interpreter:
      profile: debug
```

This cargo profile is independent of Flutter's `--debug`/`--release`; the
Flutter mode only decides *which* crate is built (debug → interpreter,
release/profile → AOT).
